		<span class="texto">Mark Boulton Design was a small design studio. In<br> 2014, <a href="">we were aquired by Monotype</a>.<br><br>Over the years, we <a href="">built an amazing team</a> and worked<br> on some <a href="">tremendous projects with the smartest<br> clients</a>. That's something we're proud of, and thankful<br> for. But, it's time for a change.<br><br>The move to Monotype brings us closer to the<br> problems we want to fix. Mark Boutlon Design is now <br>closed. The team will be working on Monotype<br> projects from the same premises in the UK and we'll<br> still be writing, blogging, and still speaking at web <br>conferences. We're not going anywhere.</span>
